Description: Provide a user interface for conditionally normalising a time series. We introduce a novel approach to normalize time series data conditional on a set of covariates. We do this by modeling the conditional mean and the conditional variance of the time series with generalized additive models using a set of covariates. The conditional mean and variance are then used to normalize the time series. It also includes functions to calculate conditional cross-correlation, conditional auto-correlation and estimate time delay between two sensors.
