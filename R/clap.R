#' clap: Detecting Class Overlapping Regions in Multidimensional Dat
#' @description The issue of overlapping regions in
#' multidimensional data arises when different classes
#' or clusters share similar feature representations,
#' making it challenging to delineate distinct boundaries
#' between them accurately. This package provides methods
#' for detecting and visualizing these overlapping
#' regions using partitional clustering techniques
#' based on nearest neighbor distances.
